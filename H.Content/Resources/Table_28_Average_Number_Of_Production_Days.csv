,,,,,,"""2 For the farrow-to-wean and farrow-to-finish production systems, the following assumptions have been made: just one group of gilts enters the barn each year as replacement breeding animals for older sows that are to be culled from the breeding stock, so there is just one “Gilt” production cycle per year as following their first litter they are referred to as sows; the entire production cycle for sows equals 140 days (5 days open + 114 gestating + 21 lactating) and that the “open” period is equivalent to a “rest” or “non-production” period; there is just a single management period for boars, which are present in the barn year-round – these animals are used for heat detection as it is assumed that the default farm practises artificial insemination using off-farm boars, which are not considered as a default in the Holos"""
,,,,,,"""3 The default number of days between production cycles for piglets is based on the duration between the weaning of one litter and the birth of the next; for weaners, it is based on the duration between one group of weaners passing to the grower-finisher stage and the next group of piglets being weaned; for grower-finisher hogs, it is based on the duration between one group of hogs leaving the system for slaughter and the next group exiting the weaner stage"""
